        "description": "Auto insurance is an agreement between you and your insurance provider about what would happen in the event of an accident. It protects you from financial losses in the event of incidents covered by your policy. Rather than being on the hook for things like repair, replacement costs and even medical bills, you pay a car insurance premium to your insurance provider and they will help cover the costs based upon the coverage and limits you choose."
